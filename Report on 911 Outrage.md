# REPORT ON 911 OUTAGE
by S3C9 Tiger Li

## What are the problems here and what caused them?
As the titile shown, Washington State suffered from severe 911 emergency call system outages in the midnight of 9 April 2014.

This is because the 40 million call limit of the software was reached, and the system stopped accepting new calls. Moreover, emergency call-routing system did not send out an operator alarm until one hour later; and when it finally did, the outage was ironically classified as a "low level" problem, resulting in little attention from the staff.

The cause of this break down is the incompatibility between the old and new emergency calling systems. Washington State was  about to update their system at the moment; however, "the interaction of new [Next Generation 911 (NG911)] and old [traditional circuit-switched time division multiplexing (TDM)] systems is introducing fragility into the communications system that is more important in times of dire need."

## How can other cities and municipalities avoid such problems?
First, they could implement the system update by making the old and new systems working parallelly, so that it could avoid system fragility caused by inefficient intercations.

Second, they should modify the software with respect to the following requirements. 1. the software should reclassify 911 outage as a problem that has higher emergency level to raise enough attention of the staff; 2. capacity should be extended so that the system could handle more than merely 40 million calss; 3. it is advisable to enable the software call a maintenance team automatically right after it detects an outage.
